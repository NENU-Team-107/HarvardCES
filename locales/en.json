Professor Chan has been an Elected Fellow of the American Psychological Association since 2008 and a Fellow of the Hong Kong Psychological Society since 2007.\n\nIn 2008, in recognition of his contribution to psychology and rehabilitation sciences, Professor Chan received the Global Leadership in Rehabilitation Science Award from Virginia Commonwealth University in the United States. In 2011, he received the Alumni Honour Award from the University of Alberta in recognition of his influence in research and education development in rehabilitation in Asia. In 2018, Professor Chan and his research team won the First Prize in Science and Technology from the Chinese Association of Rehabilitation Medicine on post-stroke cognitive assessment and intervention innovation. In 2019, his research team won the Second Class State Scientific and Technology Progress Award from the State Council of the People’s Republic of China for integrating Chinese medicine into innovative post-stroke rehabilitation.\n\nProfessor Chan’s research work focuses on exploring mechanisms underlying human learning, particularly perceptual and cross-modal learning employing brain imaging, electroencephalograms, and behavioural methods. He also applies the mechanisms to understand the behaviours of people with disabilities and older individuals, and design interventions to enhance the functional capabilities of these individuals. He has published more than 200 research papers and secured more than $20 million in competitive research and development grants. Professor Chan is the chief specialty editor of Frontiers in Rehabilitation Science and an associate editor of Journal of Sports and Health Science.",
