EdUHK has become the largest tertiary institution specialized in teacher education in Hong Kong and is recognized internationally for its leadership in education. It is ranked 6th globally in Education and Educational Research in the 2024-2025 U.S. News & World Report’s Best Global Universities Rankings. The 16th China Education Symposium in 2025, besides being held at Harvard, will also collaborate with EdUHK to create a groundbreaking event known as the Joint Symposium on Emerging Technologies and Future Talent. Knowledge knows no bounds! This is a trail-blazing attempt to enhance cooperation between prestigious Chinese and American universities and leading industries in technology and talent development, so as to expand the influence of this iconic symposium of Harvard’s Graduate School of Education to Asia.\n\nSupported by President John Chi Kin Lee of EdUHK and The CES, the Symposium boasts an impressive roster of speakers from globally recognized institutions such as Harvard, Stanford, Cambridge, University of Toronto, and Peking University. It also features technology and education policymakers and experts from Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR to deliver keynote and plenary speeches. We are honored to welcome Presidents from prestigious universities and professors from the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Education University of Hong Kong to deliver keynote speeches. Each speaker will contribute a rich blend of current insights and research advancements in emerging technologies, education, and talent cultivation. The CES team of Harvard will also conduct a thematic workshop and interact with students and staff from EdUHK and beyond before or after the Symposium.\n\nThis joint Symposium will not only be a feast of knowledge, but also a collision of sparks where diverse thoughts converge across different times and spaces!"
