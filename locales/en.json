Mitchell’s first research project in online learning started in 2009, when he and six undergraduate students built Stanford CourseWare, an innovative platform that expanded to support interactive video and discussion. CourseWare served as the foundation for initial flipped classroom experiments at Stanford and helped inspire the first massive open online courses (MOOCs) from Stanford. As Co-Director of the Lytics Lab, Carta Lab, and Pathways Lab, he has worked to improve educational outcomes through data-driven research and iterative design.

Such agents can lead  and support learning activities such as collaborative brainstorming, planning, rehearsal, reflection, and peer mentoring,  Building on early exploration by design teams composed of students and colleagues,  we have developed a series of experimental platforms that leverage GenAI to provide feedback on student writing, comment on group discussion, and structure hybrid teams in which one or more AI agents collaborate with one or more humans.  These tools show promise for  a wide range of learning contexts, some of which will be described in more detail in this talk."

          "abstract": "Knowledge representations and interactions are at the forefront of teaching, learning, and career planning activities in all endeavors of education and career development. University students are increasingly faced with a myriad of interdisciplinary topics that are seemingly unrelated when unstructured knowledge representations are presented, especially during advising and career orientation sessions. This is especially challenging in fast-changing technical domains such as Computer and Data Science where university curricula are reviewed on an annual basis. This makes it increasingly difficult for instructors and administrators to present both the big picture as well as the detailed knowledge components of degree programs to students who face problems in choosing a career and/or establishing a plan of study and assessment. In this talk, I shall introduce the KCUBE project, a knowledge graph (KG) framework equipped with virtual reality for structuring and presenting both the overviews of the Computer Science curriculum taught at the Department of Computing in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, as well as for students to develop their study with the help of virual tutor/mentor. We employ computational information storage and retrieval methods, machine learning, and interactive virtual reality to facilitate users (instructors and students) to better understand, manipulate, and visualize abstract concepts and relationships in the development of teaching and learning activities in our department."
